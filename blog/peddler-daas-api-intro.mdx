The Peddler DaaS API also provides businesses with real-time delivery updates, which is a crucial benefit for businesses to keep their customers informed. As soon as a delivery is dispatched, our API provides updates on the delivery status, including the estimated time of arrival and any potential delays. This level of transparency helps businesses keep their customers informed and provides them with peace of mind knowing their orders are on their way.

The Peddler DaaS API also offers businesses the ability to customize their delivery options. Businesses can choose to offer same-day or next-day delivery, as well as set specific delivery windows that work for them and their customers. By providing businesses with the ability to customize their delivery options, we help them provide a personalized and convenient delivery experience for their customers.

Finally, the Peddler DaaS API provides businesses with access to valuable delivery data and analytics. By analyzing delivery data, businesses can gain insights into delivery performance and identify areas for improvement. This data can help businesses optimize their delivery processes, improve customer satisfaction, and increase overall operational efficiency.

In conclusion, the Peddler DaaS API provides businesses with a flexible, transparent, customizable, cost-effective, and data-driven delivery solution.
